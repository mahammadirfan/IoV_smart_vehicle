# IoV_based_smart_vehicle_management_system
This article describes the IoV communication technology to control and monitor in vehicle prototype based device as connected sensors. In addition to providing an internet of things (IoT) platform over the mobile application platform.
The Ideal purpose of the work is to develop a signal generating kit which locks/unlocks the car doors anywhere through tablet or smart phone. Moreover, we can monitor parameters through smart phone application, the monitoring of tyre air pressure and fuel level through respective sensors network.
Haedwares used: GSM SIM900,Arduino nano, BMP sensor,Potentiometric based fuel sensor,Car Actutor,power supply and battery
Software: Arduino IDE,Proteus simulation & Android application.
